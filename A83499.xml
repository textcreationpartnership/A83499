            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Maſter <hi>PIM</hi> ſpake to this Effect following.</head>
            <p>THat Parliament the fountaine of Iuſtice, ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved pure. From Corruption and be preſerved free from partiality. Which will adde not only Luſtre, Reputation, and Honour, but Authority, to what is done in Parliament. All mens eſtates and liberties are preſerved under the ſafe Cuſtody of Parliament; This moveth us to bee carefull of any thing that may prejudice the Parliament. In point of Freedome, and Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
            <p>That therefore the <hi>Knights, Citizens,</hi> and <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> of the Houſe of Commons had commanded him with his Colleague, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent unto their Lordſhips Two Propoſitions, which they hold of very great Importance, and Neceſſitie to be put in Execution at this time.</p>
            <p>Firſt that thoſe thirteene <hi>Biſhops</hi> which ſtand accuſed before your Lordſhips for making the late Booke of Canons, and putting them in Execution that they may be excluded from their Votes in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That all the <hi>Biſhops</hi> may be excluded from having any Vote in that Act. Come from the Houſe of Commons, to your Lords. Lord-ſhips Entituled an Act to take away the <hi>Biſhops</hi> Vote in Parliament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That, that which concerneth the thirteene <hi>Biſhops,</hi> falleth to his charge to open; That he is commanded to tell their Lords ſhips that it ſtandeth with Honour and with juſtice, that theſe <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thus charged with the breach of Truſt, and of the Higheſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:112372:3"/>
Truſt, againſt the Prerogative of the King, againſt the Priviledge of Parliament, againſt the property of the Subject, and againſt the peace of the Kingdome. Theſe are the Iewels that are depoſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Truſt and ſafe-gard of Parliaments; And all theſe have been broken, and this appeareth by the making of the new Canons Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by You<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Lordſhips to be againſt all theſe Truſts.</p>
            <p>That theſe Perſons have beene parties to the breach of this Truſt, that will appeare by the Iournalls of the Convocation, which is now in the Country, and may bee ſent for; The Entry of the Book is, that all the thirteene <hi>Biſhops</hi> were Parties and did confirme and ſubcribe theſe Canons; Therefore it is hoped by theſe Canons, that theſe that have aſſumed to themſelves a <hi>Legiſlative</hi> power whereby they have as much as in them lye rooted out the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Parliament; That they ſhould have no Intereſt in the <hi>Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative</hi> power at all in Parliament.</p>
            <p>Next that thoſe that have deprived the Subjects of thoſe good Lawes that are already made for them, that they ſhould have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or part of making future Lawes for the Subject. This they conceive ſtandeth with a great deale of equitie and juſtice, which is one reaſon to deſire they ſhould bee excluded from their Votes in <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next is the haynouſneſſe of their offence, It is very fit they ſhould bee Innocent men, and faithfull men, that ſhould have the exerciſe of ſo great a thing (as that is) much leſſe Delinquents, of ſo high a Nature, Actors in the ſubverting of the Lawes of the Realme, that they ſhould continue their Votes and places in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. And that their delinquency may the better appeare, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">Here the Votes were read by Mr. <hi>Good-Wyn.</hi>
               </note> to reade the Votes paſſed in the Houſe of Commons <hi>(nullo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicente)</hi> and with which the LORDS have concurred and agreed.</p>

            <p>THat hee was in the next place to preſent ſome reaſons <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Saint-Iohn.</hi>

            <p>Firſt, becauſe they have no ſuch Inherent right, and liberty of being there, as the Lords Temporall, and the Peeres of the Realme have. For they are not there repreſentative of any body elſe, not of the Clergy; If ſo, then the Clergie were twice repreſented by them, in the Lords Houſe and in the Convocation, for their Writ of Election is to ſend two Clerkes <hi>Ad conſentiendum, &amp;c.</hi> Beſides none are there repreſentative of others, but thoſe that have their ſuffrage from others. And therefore only the Clerkes in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation doe repreſent them.</p>
            <p>Next, they have not the Inherent right of Peerage as the Lords have, becauſe in ſome things they cannot doe that there, which the Lords may doe. In caſe of Treaſon and matter of bloud, upon try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of any Peere, they have no Liberty of Vote, which could not be taken away by any Canon if their Right of Voting there were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent; But this in the generall.</p>
            <p>Next that they ought to bee excluded from their Votes, If they were Repreſentative of the Clergie as a third eſtate and degree, which is this; <hi>No Act of Parliament could bee good if they did wholly diſſaſſent,</hi> and yet they have diſaſſented and the law good and in force, as in the Booke of Common Prayer, in Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> time they did diſſaſſent from the confirming of that Law, which could not have beene good if they had bin a third eſtate and diſaſſented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:112372:4"/>
Next that the King may hold his Parliament without calling the <hi>Biſhops</hi> at all to it which hath beene adjudged by all the <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
